# nosql-challenge
In this project, I analyzed a json file from the UK Food Standards Agency that evaluates restaurants in the UK. I used pymongo code in jupyter notebook to set up a database. I then updated the database, and created a pipeline to analyze the data.

To find my setup code, look in the file named 'NOSQL_setup_starter' in the 'Starter_code' folder. My analysis is in the file named 'NOSQL_analysis_starter' located in the 'Starter_code' folder. The json file I used is located in the 'Resources' folder.
